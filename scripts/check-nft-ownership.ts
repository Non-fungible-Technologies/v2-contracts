/**
 * This script checks ownership by the borrower of a collateralized
 * NFT - for example, for Discord token-gated access Ã  la Collab.land.
 *
 * If this script returns true, it means that the user in question (the USER parameter)
 * is currently borrowing against the specified NFT (the NFT parameter). This means
 * that they own the NFT and should pass any token-gated access.
 *
 * The BorrowerNote (BORROWER_NOTE_ADDRESS) contract is the ERC721 representing
 * a borrower's obligation in a loan. The LoanCore (LOAN_CORE_ADDRESS) contract
 * is the main lending protocol contract, which stores data for each open loan.
 * The VaultFactory (VAULT_FACTORY_ADDRESS) is an ERC721 tracking ownership of asset
 * vaults, which are smart contracts which can hold "bundles" of multiple items
 * of collateral. Each asset vault is its own smart contract whose address is
 * equal to the token ID tracked in the vault factory.
